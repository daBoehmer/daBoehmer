### Hey!
What's up? I'm David, a 17 years old German high school student.
I am most interested in topics like AI/ML and simulations which is also included in the long term project I am working on right now.
Next to school I am studying at the TU Berlin as a "Sch√ºlerstudent" which means I am *not* immatriculated.
If you have any ideas on which you want to collaborate, hit me up! My strongest programming knowledge lays in Python and my 2nd strongest knowledge in C#.
